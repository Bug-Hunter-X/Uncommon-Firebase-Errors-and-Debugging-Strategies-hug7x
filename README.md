# Uncommon Firebase Errors and Debugging Strategies
This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors encountered when using the Firebase JavaScript SDK and offers solutions to address them.  The examples highlight issues related to configuration, asynchronous operations, data types, and security rules. Each example shows the problematic code and then the corrected version.

## Errors Covered:
- **Incorrect Firebase Configuration:** Demonstrates how an invalid configuration can lead to unexpected errors.
- **Asynchronous Operation Handling:** Shows the importance of proper error handling in asynchronous operations using `.catch()`.
- **Data Type Issues:** Illustrates the impact of incorrect data types passed to Firebase functions.
- **Security Rules Errors:** Highlights the significance of properly configuring security rules to prevent unexpected behavior.

## How to Use:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run the examples to observe the errors (firebaseBug.js) and their solutions (firebaseBugSolution.js).
