To address these issues, ensure that your Firebase configuration is properly set. Add `.catch()` blocks to handle potential errors in asynchronous operations. Verify that the data types you are passing to Firebase are correct. Check the security rules of your project to ensure proper authorization and data access control.  Always consult the official Firebase documentation for best practices and troubleshooting guidance.
